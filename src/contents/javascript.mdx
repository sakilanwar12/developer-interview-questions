### 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
It can run both in the browser and on the server (using environments like Node.js).

### 2. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, == is the loose equality operator, which compares two values for equality after performing type coercion if necessary. This means it converts the operands to the same type before performing the comparison.

=== is the strict equality operator, which compares both the values and their types, without performing type conversion.

### 4. What is a Variable Scope in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, we have each variable are accessed and modified through either one of the given scope:

- **Global Scope**: Outermost level (accessible everywhere).
- **Local Scope**: Inner functions can access variables from their parent functions due to lexical scoping.
- **Function Scope**: Variables are confined to the function they are declared in.
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with let or const are confined to the nearest block (loops, conditionals, etc.).

### 5. Why do we use the word “debugger” in JavaScript?

The debugger for the browser must be activated in order to debug the code. Built-in debuggers may be switched on and off, requiring the user to report faults. The remaining section of the code should stop execution before moving on to the next line while debugging.
